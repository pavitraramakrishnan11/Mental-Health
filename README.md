# Mental-Health
This study is done to explore two datasets based on demographics and age groups to identify the global mental health trends with growing time.
A Path to Well-being: Mental Health Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores mental health trends using two openly available datasets:
1. **Indicators of Anxiety and Depression** (Kaggle)  
2. **Prevalence and Impact of Mental Illness** (AIHW, Australia)  

## Problem Statements
1. Can demographic factors (age, sex, disability, sexual orientation, etc.) predict whether an individual is at risk of anxiety or depression?  
2. Can lifestyle and long-term health condition data alone reliably predict mental health outcomes?  

## Datasets
**Indicators of Anxiety and Depression (Kaggle):**
  US-based survey data categorized by age, sex, disability, education, and more.  
**AIHW Prevalence & Impact of Mental Illness:**  
  Australian data on long-term mental health conditions by demographic groups.  

## Data Insights
- Young adults (18–29) reported the highest rates of anxiety and depression (~35%).  
- Women and people with disabilities showed higher vulnerability (30–45% symptoms).  
- LGBTQ+ groups exhibited elevated stress levels (30–40%).  
- Long-term illness prevalence is increasing steadily in Australia over the last decade.  

## Key Takeaways
- Demographics (age, sex, disability, sexual orientation) are strong indicators of mental health risk.  
- Lifestyle/illness data alone is not enough — a multi-dimensional approach is required.  
- Both datasets combined give a holistic view: global trends + Australian health context.  

## Future Recommendations
- Conduct inclusive data collection (parental background, trauma, environment).  
- Focus on targeted interventions for women, young adults, and disabled communities.  
- Regular surveys & AI-powered dashboards for health service planning.
